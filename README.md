#VMVM - Unit Test Virtualization for Java
==========
**VMVM** is a system for isolating unit tests with very low overhead.

This repository contains the source and a [runnable binary](https://github.com/Programming-Systems-Lab/vmvm/blob/master/binaries/vmvm.jar) for **VMVM**.

###For more information
Please refer to our [ICSE '14 Paper](http://jonbell.net/publications/vmvm) or email [Jonathan Bell](mailto:jbell@cs.columbia.edu)

Running
-----
### Instrumenting your code
Execute the instrumenter by running the jar file (all libraries are self-contained). The first argument is the folder containing the project to instrument. The second argument is the destination for the instrumented version.
Example:
`java -jar vmvm.jar folder-to-instrument folder-dest`


### Modifying your build scripts
To automatically have VMVM be called by ant, modify the `junit` task of your `build.xml` file to add the following elements:

```xml
<classpath>
<pathelement path="ant-mvn-formatter.jar" />
<pathelement location="vmvm.jar"/>
<pathelement location="gen/"/>
</classpath>
<formatter classname="edu.columbia.cs.psl.vmvm.AntJUnitTestListener" extension=".xml"/>
<jvmarg value="-Xbootclasspath/a:vmvm.jar"/>
```

Make sure that the paths are correct to [vmvm.jar](https://github.com/Programming-Systems-Lab/vmvm/blob/master/binaries/vmvm.jar) and [ant-mvn-formatter.jar](https://github.com/Programming-Systems-Lab/vmvm/blob/master/binaries/ant-mvn-formatter.jar); the "gen" folder is automatically generated by VMVM and contains various stubs. Also be sure that your `junit` task has the argument `forkMode="once"` (e.g. that it won't fork a new process for each test, defating the purpose of VMVM).

That's it. You may also need to include the vmvm.jar in the ant master classpath, by adding the argument `-lib vmvm.jar` when you invoke ant.

To automatically have VMVM be called by mvn, modify the `pom.xml` file for your project as follows:

1.	Make sure that you are using a recent version of the surefire plugin (e.g., 2.15)
1.	Add the [vmvm.jar](https://github.com/Programming-Systems-Lab/vmvm/blob/master/binaries/vmvm.jar) and [ant-mvn-formatter.jar](https://github.com/Programming-Systems-Lab/vmvm/blob/master/binaries/ant-mvn-formatter.jar) to the surefire additional classpath (e.g. within the plugin configuration for surefire add):

```xml
<additionalClasspathElements>
<additionalClasspathElement>vmvm.jar</additionalClasspathElement>
<additionalClasspathElement>ant-mvn-formatter.jar</additionalClasspathElement>
<additionalClasspathElement>gen/</additionalClasspathElement>
</additionalClasspathElements>
```

3.	Register the VMVM test listener with surefire. If you don't have any other properties set for the surefire plugin, then that would look like this:

```xml
<properties>
<property>
<name>listener</name>
<value>edu.columbia.cs.psl.vmvm.MvnVMVMListener</value>
</property>
</properties>
```

Here's an example of a complete pom.xml block declaring the surefire plugin and registering VMVM with it:
```xml
<plugin>
	<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
	<artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
	<version>2.16</version>
	<configuration>
		<additionalClasspathElements>
		<additionalClasspathElement>vmvm.jar</additionalClasspathElement>
		<additionalClasspathElement>ant-mvn-formatter.jar</additionalClasspathElement>
	</additionalClasspathElements>
		<properties>
		<property>
			<name>listener</name>
			<value>edu.columbia.cs.psl.vmvm.MvnVMVMListener</value>
		</property>
		</properties>
	</configuration>
	<executions>
		<execution>
		<id>plain</id>
		<configuration>
			<includes>
				<include>**/*Test.java</include>
			</includes>
		</configuration>
		</execution>
	</executions>
</plugin>
```
