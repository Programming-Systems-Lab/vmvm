#VMVM - Unit Test Virtualization for Java
==========
**VMVM** is a system for isolating unit tests with very low overhead.

This repository is contains information related to the tool VMVM presented at ICSE, 2014. 

This repository is not the original repository for this tool. 

This repository was constructed by Sumeet Agarwal, Vineela Boddula, Sarah Elder, Shrenuj Gandhi, and Alex Valkovsky under the supervision of Emerson Murphy-Hill. 

This repository contains the source and a [runnable binary](https://github.com/Programming-Systems-Lab/vmvm/blob/master/binaries/vmvm.jar) for **VMVM**.

###For more information
Please refer to our [ICSE '14 Paper](http://jonbell.net/publications/vmvm) or email [Jonathan Bell](mailto:jbell@cs.columbia.edu)

Running
-----
### Instrumenting your code
Execute the instrumenter by running the jar file (all libraries are self-contained). The first argument is the folder containing the project to instrument. The second argument is the destination for the instrumented version.
Example:
`java -jar vmvm.jar folder-to-instrument folder-dest`


### Modifying your build scripts
To automatically have VMVM be called by ant, modify the `junit` task of your `build.xml` file to add the following elements:

```xml
<classpath>
    <pathelement path="ant-mvn-formatter.jar" />
    <pathelement location="vmvm.jar"/>
    <pathelement location="gen/"/>
</classpath>
<formatter classname="edu.columbia.cs.psl.vmvm.AntJUnitTestListener" extension=".xml"/>
<jvmarg value="-Xbootclasspath/a:vmvm.jar"/>
```

Make sure that the paths are correct to [vmvm.jar](https://github.com/Programming-Systems-Lab/vmvm/blob/master/binaries/vmvm.jar) and [ant-mvn-formatter.jar](https://github.com/Programming-Systems-Lab/vmvm/blob/master/binaries/ant-mvn-formatter.jar); the "gen" folder is automatically generated by VMVM and contains various stubs. Also be sure that your `junit` task has the argument `forkMode="once"` (e.g. that it won't fork a new process for each test, defating the purpose of VMVM).

That's it. You may also need to include the vmvm.jar in the ant master classpath, by adding the argument `-lib vmvm.jar` when you invoke ant.

To automatically have VMVM be called by mvn, modify the `pom.xml` file for your project as follows:

1.	Make sure that you are using a recent version of the surefire plugin (e.g., 2.15)
2.  Declare the VMVM dependencies:

```xml
  <dependency>
  	 <groupId>edu.columbia.cs.psl.vmvm</groupId>
  	 <artifactId>vmvm</artifactId>
  	 <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  	 <scope>test</scope>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
  	 <groupId>edu.columbia.cs.psl.vmvm</groupId>
  	 <artifactId>vmvm-ant-junit-formatter</artifactId>
  	 <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  	 <scope>test</scope>
  </dependency>
```

3.	Register the VMVM test listener with surefire. If you don't have any other properties set for the surefire plugin, then that would look like this:

```xml
<properties>
   <property>
      <name>listener</name>
      <value>edu.columbia.cs.psl.vmvm.MvnVMVMListener</value>
   </property>
</properties>
```

Here's an example of a mininal `pom.xml` block declaring the Maven Surefire plugin using the VMVM with it:

```xml
<plugin>
	<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
	<artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
	<version>2.18.1</version>
	<configuration>
		<properties>
			<property>
				<name>listener</name>
				<value>edu.columbia.cs.psl.vmvm.MvnVMVMListener</value>
			</property>
		</properties>
	</configuration>				
	<executions>
		<execution>
			<id>plain</id>
			<configuration>
				<includes>
					<include>**/*Test.java</include>
				</includes>
			</configuration>
		</execution>
	</executions>
</plugin>
```
